# what is this?
this is a game engine i made in c# because i had to make a text rpg game. so naturally i instead made a port of ace attourney in the console.

# will this ever be finished or in a useable state?
no, you can pay me Â£100 to finish it because i don't want to ever touch c# again.

# why won't the executable run?
because all the resource files are in the project directory, if you want it to work you need to run it from visual studio.
so sue me.

# why do you hate c#?
because it is an abstraction hellscape of an OOP language, it runs slower than java, it's bassically just java actually, and on top of that it was made by micropenis software so expect it to run exactly how windows runs- like a bloated inneficient memory leaking mess.

# can i steal your source code?
well it's not like i can stop you anyways. feel free to take the console api file, i wouldn't force my worst enemies to sit through the god awful loading times of pinvoke for those kernel32 bindings.
